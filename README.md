# Info
------------------------
The AirConsole-Unity-Plugin is a C# wrapper for the AirConsole Javascript API.
AirConsole provides a simple to use Javascript API for game developers to build 
their own local multiplayer realtime browser games.
You can find the Javascript API documentation here: http://developers.airconsole.com/#/api

IMPORTANT: The plugin comes with an embedded webserver / websocket-server for the communication between the AirConsole backend and the Unity-Editor. 
You don't need to install any other webserver or services.

# Documentation
------------------------
All install instructions and examples are documented in the file "Documentation_1.7.0.pdf" inside this folder. 
There are more examples on the website: http://developers.airconsole.com/#/guides

# Platforms
------------------------
Since the AirConsole is working with HTML5 and Javascript, you can only make use of this 
plugin when you switch your target build to WebGL.
