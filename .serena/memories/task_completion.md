# Task Completion Checklist
- Ensure changes build inside the Unity Editor and do not break the AirConsole example scenes.
- Run relevant Unity EditMode/PlayMode tests through the Unity Test Runner if scripts were modified.
- Update README/CHANGELOG or documentation PDF references if behavior changes.
- Verify WebGL/Android-specific behavior when applicable (e.g., platform messaging, webview debugging instructions).
- Commit with clear messages and keep the embedded webserver/websocket functionality intact.
