# Style and Conventions
- Code is written in standard Unity/C# style (PascalCase for classes/methods, camelCase for private fields, serialized fields attributed as needed).
- Project relies on Unity-specific patterns (MonoBehaviours, scriptable objects, etc.); follow Unity's serialization and inspector conventions when modifying scripts.
- No repository-specific linting or formatting rules were documented, so adhere to default C# conventions and Unity best practices.
